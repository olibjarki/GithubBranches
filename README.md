# GithubBranches

Our group consisted of two students. We followed the required GitHub workflow as outlined in the assignment.

- The first student created a new GitHub repository, added several files, and invited the second student as a collaborator.

- The second student received the invitation and accepted the collaboration request.

- The second student cloned the repository to the local computer and created a new feature branch.

- The second student made changes to the code, committed the updates, and pushed the new branch to GitHub.

- The second student opened a pull request without merging it.

- The first student reviewed the pull request and added a comment as part of the code review.

- The first student merged the pull request into the main branch.

- Both students switched to the main branch locally and pulled the latest changes to ensure that the merged code was now available.

This completed the required workflow and demonstrated our ability to collaborate using branches, pull requests, and code reviews.
